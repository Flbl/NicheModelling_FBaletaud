# Main lines

This Rmd is aimed at describing how the script 04_EEZ_map.R works while running it. It is the first script coming after the 1st model on bioclimatic variables. This time on a regional/local scale (= New caledonian EEZ), the geomorphic variables are prepared. The goal is to get a data frame with the cover values (in kmÂ²) of each geomorphic features (see blue habitats layers.Rmd) in each cells (we keep the grid from the first model, cropped to the eez).

# The script

We start off by reading the script
```{r}
read_chunk("./Scripts/04_EEZ_map.R")
```

## earthGrid

First step is to get the NC's eez from the grid of the first model

```{r earthGRID}


plot(earthGrid)
```
